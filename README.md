COP 1500: Text Based Adventure Game

Text Based Survival Game: Nerve
Difficulty Rating: Intermediate
Rating: PG-13 Minor Violence


Summary:
This game was inspired by Zork, an extremely old Text Based Adventure game made with simplistic code.
My games main goal is to expemplify a basic funadmental understanding of Python and some main operation functions and code
Most of the game is text, due to the required setting description and direction.

Warnings: 
1) Type answers exact, capital letters are used for answers, you will lose if you type incorrectly
2) The game requires a lot of thought, you will likely lose initially and have to work towards the end.
3) The lives system is yet to be implemented, struggled to find code that can clarify how to use a lives systems
4) If you lose, you will be prompted to close the game and restart it, select Yes, if you do not it will keep running as if you were correct, do not cheat please.
